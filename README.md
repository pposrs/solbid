A unified bidding layer for .sol domains that aggregates escrow liquidity. Instead of locking funds per domain, users deposit once and bid across multiple auctions simultaneously. This unlocks capital efficiency, reduces friction, and enables a more liquid, competitive market for Solana Name Service domains.
